RS232 serial port is a legacy port that was used for printers the
mouse and other equipment. It allows byte wide data to the
transmitted and received on one wire (plus ground) thus reducing the
cost of cabling. Many new machines omit the serial port completely
but it still has its uses-</SPAN></FONT></P>

	IO port control of the output and input bits. The inputs can cope
	with anything up to +- 30v input, and the outputs can drive a small
	LED. On a desktop the outputs have enough current drive to power a
	small microprocessor. Outputs vary and have a voltage of between
	+-3v to +-12v with an impedance of between 3000-7000 ohms.<BR>Using
	added electronics its possible to directly control 240v power
	opto-triacs and all kinds of hardware.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Note
that USB to serial port converters cost only a few dollars.  The
access rate for the control registers is at best 250 Hz,  much slower
than the 1MHz of a real serial port.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">There
are 3 ways to work with the serial port-</FONT></P>
<OL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Use
	and application program such as the gtkterm or putty to send
	characters to the serial port and display what has been received.
	This is a simple way to check your port works. Simply connect pins 2
	and 3 on the RS-232 port (male DB-9 or DB-25) and see if what you
	type is echoed back.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Drive
	the serial port from C or C++ code using the operating system API.
	The operating system handles all the interrupted driven operation
	and buffering.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Drive
	the IO ports in the modem directly from C or C++ code. This can get
	higher speed operation but is more complex (unless just bit port
	control is required).</FONT></P>
